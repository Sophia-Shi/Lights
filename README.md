# Lights

A Haskell game inspired by Bulls and Cows. 
Where a unknow sequence of 5 lights are lit up and the goal is to guess the color of each light. 
Lights are of color Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange or Purple.
The program generates a random sequence of color each time. 
When the player makes a guess, the program will show the number of correct lights (both color and position) as well as the number of miss-placed colors.

Make sure to install System.Random before runing the game.
stack install random
